I'm an undergraduate majoring in Biological engineering at the School of Chemistry and Life Sciences [url](https://scls.hust.edu.vn/), Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam. Throughout my journey, I've been fortunate to be surrounded by inspiring mentors and talented peers, which has fueled my deep passion for various scientific fields, especially [microbiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology) and [astrobiology](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about/).

My research interests focus on the identification and preservation of microbial strains, microbial diversity, metagenomics, genome breeding, and systems metabolic engineering.

I am also interested in applying biological approaches to tackle questions at the intersection of biology and other disciplines, including astrobiology, biophysics, environmental biology, evolutionary biology, and geomicrobiology. Kindly refer [here](assets\pdf\Statement of Interest.pdf) for details.

In my spare time, I often immerse myself in books and [musics](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Vpenzl2qq0ya9ipYPRt40?si=4abd837320504070), play badminton, or go [trekking](/figures/my_fig/trekking_with_friends.jpg). My favorite anime character at the moment is Binchou-tan.

I also sometimes play video games, one of my most memorable moments was winning the [gold medal](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=814806730645507&set=pcb.814827817310065) in Arena of Valor category at Elympics 2023 ([FOC-VNNTU](https://www.facebook.com/FOCVNNTU)) with my amazing teammates.
