#### Introduction to R

- [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.  
  This was my first book on R, and I believe it's a comprehensive resource for data science, covering both data transformation and visualization.

- [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (3e)](https://ggplot2-book.org/) by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen.

- [Data Visualization: A practical introduction](https://socviz.co/index.html#preface) by Kieran Healy.

- If you want to create reports or documents that capture both your R code and your thought process, R Markdown (with [The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)) might be the ideal tool.

- [Posit Cheatsheets](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/) are concise reference guides that summarize essential R functions and syntax from the 'tidyverse' package for quick and efficient coding.

#### Documents Focusing on Visualization

- [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/index.html) by Claus O. Wilke.  
  As the title suggests, this book offers a theoretical foundation for data visualization without involving any coding. It features plenty of examples that highlight the difference between poor and effective figures.
  I particularly enjoyed Part II, which significantly changed the way I think about aesthetics in visual design. The codes for all the figures can be found at [here](https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz).

- [Data-to-Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) and
  [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/)
  are excellent resources that helps you quickly choose the most appropriate type of graph to represent your data.

- [R Graphics Cookbook (2e)](https://r-graphics.org/preface) by Winston Chang.

- [Modern Data Visualization with R](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/index.html) by Robert Kabacoff.

#### R Packages

- The [ggplot2 extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/) website
  features over hundred registered packages developed by R users in the community, aimed at creating a wide variety of __specialized and advanced graphs__.  
  My favourite packages are plotly ([to makes interactive graphs](https://plotly.com/r/)),
  ggrepel, ggpubr ([to mix multiple graphs](https://www.sthda.com/english/articles/24-ggpubr-publication-ready-plots/81-ggplot2-easy-way-to-mix-multiple-graphs-on-the-same-page/)),
  ggtext,
  [tidyplots](https://tidyplots.org/), ggpattern and ggside xP.

- You can build professional __interactive web apps__ using the shiny package ([Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/preface.html) & [Shiny for R Gallery](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/)) via RStudio and [ShinyApps](https://www.shinyapps.io/)
  or more simply with [flexdashboard](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html) via R Markdown.

#### Advanced R

- To improve your programming skills and understanding of the language, read [Advanced R (2e)](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/) by Altuna Akalin.

- To get a grip on using spatial data in your analysis, read [Spatial Data Science With Applications in R (1e)](https://r-spatial.org/book/) by Edzer Pebesma and Roger Bivand.

#### Recommended Tools and Applications

- Software for refining figures: * Inkscape - [A Guide to Inkscape](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/), * Adobe Illustrator (subscription-based), and GIMP.

- Free software for plotting graphs: * RStudio (command line), and [RAWGraphs](https://www.rawgraphs.io/) (web-based).

- Subscription-based software for plotting graphs: * BioRender (GUI), OriginLab (GUI), and GraphPad Prism (GUI).

#### Online Courses

- [Data Visualization & Dashboarding with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-visualization-dashboarding-with-r)
  is an introductory specialization on Coursera that includes five fundamental courses covering data transformation and R plotting â€” from basic to intermediate graphs and interactive web visualizations.
  With plenty of hands-on assignments, it's a great starting point for learning R while also earning a certificate.
